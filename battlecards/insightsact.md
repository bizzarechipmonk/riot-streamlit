4️⃣ Trap-Setting Questions

“Are you replacing your LMS?”

“How are you managing regulatory training today?”

“Do you want one platform or multiple?”

“Who owns compliance — HR or operations?”

5️⃣ Objection Handling

“InsightsAct has better predictive analytics.”
They’ve built strong turnover modeling tools. Many organizations prefer integrating engagement insights directly with learning, compliance, and workforce data in one platform to avoid siloed systems.

“We want best-of-breed.”
That’s completely valid. The tradeoff many clients evaluate is integration complexity and total cost of ownership when stitching platforms together.
