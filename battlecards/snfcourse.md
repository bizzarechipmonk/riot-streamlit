“Are you looking only for CNA compliance training?”

“What visibility do your regional leaders need?”

“How are you measuring staff engagement?”

They will expose gaps quickly.

5️⃣ Objection Handling

“SNFCourse is much cheaper.”
They are — and for organizations only looking for basic CNA compliance training, that can work. Many groups we speak with, though, want visibility across roles, facilities, and competencies. That’s where ACME delivers ROI beyond just content.

“We don’t need fancy features.”
Totally fair. Let me ask — how are you currently managing policy acknowledgments and audit documentation?
