4️⃣ Trap-Setting Questions

“How important is regulatory reporting depth?”

“Are you planning to expand beyond home health?”

“Do you need engagement insights across the workforce?”

“How are you managing policy updates across states?”

5️⃣ Objection Handling

“CareEd’s mobile experience is better.”
They’ve done a great job with field simplicity. Where many organizations expand beyond that is needing broader compliance coverage and deeper analytics as they grow.

“They specialize in home health.”
They do — and if you plan to stay exclusively in home health, they’re strong. Many organizations we work with eventually need broader regulatory support and policy management.
