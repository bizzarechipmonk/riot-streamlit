4️⃣ Trap-Setting Questions

“How much of your workforce is non-clinical?”

“Are you primarily driven by accreditation risk or workforce development?”

“How quickly do you need to deploy?”

“Is policy management a must-have or a nice-to-have?”

If they answer:

Deployment <90 days → MedTeach is slow.

Heavy post-acute workforce → MedTeach overbuilt.

Budget sensitive → MedTeach becomes expensive.

5️⃣ Objection Handling

“MedTeach is stronger in accreditation.”
You’re right — they are very strong in Joint Commission workflows. If accreditation tracking is your #1 objective, they’re a strong option. What many organizations find, though, is they need workforce enablement beyond accreditation — onboarding, retention, engagement — which is where ACME delivers broader value.

“They specialize in hospitals — that gives them credibility.”
Absolutely. For a tertiary care hospital, that matters. For multi-setting or post-acute organizations, their hospital-first architecture can create friction.
